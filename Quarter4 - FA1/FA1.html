    <div class="yap">
    <h2>Why Sign Up?</h2>
    <p>The Teach for the Philippines organization aims to improve the quality of teachers,
    as well as addressing education challenges at the system-level. The reason I chose this
    organization is because they have a cause that lets them support our fellow students with their 
    3 core programs, which are Fellowship Program, Ambassadors Program, and the Public School Teacher 
    Pathways. Each of which tackle various issues about our current education system in the Philippines 
    in hopes of making public education more accessible and high quality. Additionally, they also
    help teachers with these aforementioned programs, allowing them to help even more students. And lastly,
    they are a non profit organization, which means that all of their donations go into their cause
    and programs.
